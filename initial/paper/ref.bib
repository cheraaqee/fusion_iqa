@article{yang2015perceptual,
	abstract = {Research on screen content images (SCIs) becomes important as they are increasingly used in multi-device communication applications. In this paper, we present a study on perceptual quality assessment of distorted SCIs subjectively and objectively. We construct a large-scale screen image quality assessment database (SIQAD) consisting of 20 source and 980 distorted SCIs. In order to get the subjective quality scores and investigate, which part (text or picture) contributes more to the overall visual quality, the single stimulus methodology with 11 point numerical scale is employed to obtain three kinds of subjective scores corresponding to the entire, textual, and pictorial regions, respectively. According to the analysis of subjective data, we propose a weighting strategy to account for the correlation among these three kinds of subjective scores. Furthermore, we design an objective metric to measure the visual quality of distorted SCIs by considering the visual difference of textual and pictorial regions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SCI perceptual quality assessment scheme, consisting of the objective metric and the weighting strategy, can achieve better performance than 11 state-of-the-art IQA methods. To the best of our knowledge, the SIQAD is the first large-scale database published for quality evaluation of SCIs, and this research is the first attempt to explore the perceptual quality assessment of distorted SCIs},

@article{Zhang2018,
	abstract = {The recent popularity of remote desktop software and live streaming of composited video has given rise to a growing number of applications that make use of the so-called screen content images that contain a mixture of text, graphics, and photographic imagery. Automatic quality assessment (QA) of screen-content images is necessary to enable tasks, such as quality monitoring, parameter adaptation, and other optimizations. Although QA of natural images has been heavily researched over the last several decades, the QA of screen content images is a relatively new topic. In this paper, we present a QA algorithm called convolutional neural network-based screen content image quality estimator (CNN-SQE), which operates via a fuzzy classification of screen content images into plain-text, computer-graphics/cartoons, and natural-image regions. The first two classes are considered to contain synthetic content (text/graphics), and the latter two classes are considered to contain naturalistic content (graphics/photographs), where the overlap of the classes allows the computer graphics/cartoons segments to be analyzed by both text-based and natural-image-based features. We present a CNN-based approach for the classification, an edge-structure-based quality degradation model, and a region-size-adaptive quality-fusion strategy. As we will demonstrate, the proposed CNN-SQE algorithm can achieve better/competitive performance as compared with the other state-of-the-art QA algorithms.},
